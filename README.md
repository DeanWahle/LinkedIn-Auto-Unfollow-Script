## LinkedIn Auto-Unfollow Script

### Description
This script is designed to help you automatically unfollow profiles or companies on LinkedIn. It's meant to be executed in the Chrome Developer Console when you're on the LinkedIn page that lists profiles or companies you're following.

### Instructions:

1. **Navigate to LinkedIn:**
    - Log in to your LinkedIn account.
    - Visit the page where it lists profiles or companies you are following.

2. **Open Chrome Developer Console:**
    - Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" (or use `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`).
    - Click on the "Console" tab.

3. **Paste & Execute the Script:**
    - Copy the provided script.
    - Paste the script into the console.
    - Press `Enter` to execute the script.

4. **Monitor the Process:**
    - The script will start the unfollow process, logging each unfollow action to the console.
    - It will scroll down automatically to load more profiles or companies as needed.

### Notes:

- **Safety & Terms of Service:** Always use automation scripts responsibly. Executing scripts like this may violate LinkedIn's terms of service. Use at your own discretion and risk.

- **Rate Limiting:** LinkedIn might have rate limits or bot detection mechanisms. Continuous unfollow actions could trigger these. If you notice any unusual behavior, stop the script immediately.

- **Updates:** Websites often update their frontend structure. If LinkedIn changes its button names or layout, the script might not work. Always ensure that the script is up-to-date with LinkedIn's current structure.
